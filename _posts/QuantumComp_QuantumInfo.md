##### **_Nomenclature/Notation:_**   

The _nomenclature is really dense, perhaps it is a good idea to refer to it when needed. I would only say that the reader must firstly understand the Bark-Ket notatino commonly used in quantum writing: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation

_The scalar product or action is written as_:

![Bark-Ket](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%0A%0A%0A%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clangle%20%5Cphi%20%7B%5Cmid%20%7D%5Cpsi%20%5Crangle%20.%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

_The right part is called the ket /kɛt/; it is a vector, typically represented as a column vector and written_:

![Ket](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%0A%0A%0A%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20%7C%5Cpsi%20%5Crangle%20.%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)	

The left part is called the bra, /brɑː/; it is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a row vector and is written:

![brak](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%0A%0A%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Clangle%20%5Cphi%20%7C.%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

##### **_Intro:_**   

The intro is realy good to gain bird's-eye perspective. The reader would bear in mind that the book was published during the late 1990's and is not up-to-date with most recent developments.
