Hi guys,

A couple of simulations of quantum computer are in the pipeline for next weeks but in the meantime I figured the following tool could be great to get started. Wolfarm is an awesome website you have probably already used and they also do tiny bit of Quantum.

_Link:_
http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/SingleQubitQuantumGatesOnABlochSphere/

_Explanation:_
The Bloch Sphere, is a common way to visualise one qubit. Humans' fairly incapable brain can not imagine more than one qubit so perhaps we focus on one for the time being. The idea is that this space captures the multiple likelihoods for the qubit to be 0 or 1.

I highly recommend downloading the programe and playing with it.If this is helpful, I can create a video of my screen and share it in case it is more convenient. 

Cheers,
Omer
