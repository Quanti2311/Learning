#### Title: "Test of knowledge and understanding".  
#### Gist: Do you really know about QC?
---

##### Describe quantum annealing in 5 lines.

##### What is the difference between bits and qubits?

##### What is the 'Quantum Gap'?

##### Give an example of a quantum gate and explain how it works:

##### What quantum computers are good for? provide two classic examples.   
Discrete optimization problems - 

Shor's Alg:

Grover's Alg:

#### More tiny questions - know the details:

##### Why qubits represent probailities? 
Qubits essentially represent a probability for a qubit to turn into 

##### Why qubits are represented by amplitudes? 
The qubits are considered amplitudes that correspond to the square root of the probability of the bit in the classical terms.
